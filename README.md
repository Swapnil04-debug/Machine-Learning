## 🔍 Features

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Charts and graphs to explore relationships in the dataset.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning**  
  Trained a model (e.g., Linear Regression or Classification) to predict key outcomes.

- 📁 **Model Export**  
  Used `joblib` to save and load trained models efficiently.

- 📈 **Insight Evaluation**  
  Identified both positive and potentially negative impacts for business decisions.
